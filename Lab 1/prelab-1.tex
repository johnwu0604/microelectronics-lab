\subsection*{2.1.6 Design the circuit of Figure 2.1 in order to obtain a gain of $250V/V ±10\%$. Determine the values of $R_4$ and $R_5$. Discuss. At the output, take into account the loading caused by a $10X$ oscilloscope probe.}

Note \\
The P2220 oscilloscope probe can be used in 1X mode or 10X mode. The equivalent circuit models of this probe (including the oscilloscope) for each mode are quite different:  \\
- 1X mode: 1 MΩ in parallel with a 110 pF capacitance to ground.  \\
- 10X mode: 10 MΩ in parallel with a 17 pF capacitance to ground.  \\ Usually, the probe should be used in the 10X mode if possible to reduce loading effects (both capacitive and resistive). Note that a 10X probe attenuates signals by 10 times, so it may not be optimal to use the probe in this mode to measure very small signals.   Make sure to compensate your probe (see oscilloscope/probe manual) before taking measurements in order to ensure that your measured voltages are valid! If you use the oscilloscope directly with no probe (through a RG-58 coaxial cable), you load on a circuit will be similar to that of the probe in 1X mode. More specifically, the load resistance will be of 1 MΩ, and the parallel capacitance will be estimated by adding the 20 pF load of the oscilloscope to ~80 pF per meter of cable used between the circuit and oscilloscope (e.g., total capacitive load of ~100 pF for a 1 m cable)
